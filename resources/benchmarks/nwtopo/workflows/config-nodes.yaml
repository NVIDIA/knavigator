  Create a 12-nodes cluster with a tree-like network topology
  and mark 5 nodes as busy:
            __________ sw31 __________
           /            |             \
       sw21            sw22            sw23
       /  \            /  \            /  \
   sw11    sw12    sw13    sw14    sw15    sw16
    /\      /\      /\      /\      /\      /\
  n1  n2  n3  n4  n5  n6  n7  n8  n9 n10 n11 n12
  x       x           x                  x   x
  Then deploy a 3-replicas job. The optimal nodes from the
  network topology perspective for this job are nodes n5, n7, n8.
